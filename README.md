# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It is developed using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📋 Project Overview

- Input: MRI brain scan images  
- Output: Classification - Tumor detected or not  
- Approach: Image preprocessing, CNN model training, evaluation, and prediction  
- Goal: Provide an automated tool to assist in early tumor detection
